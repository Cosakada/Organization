# (Project idea Outline)

- A vocabulary app that is different in terms of the way vocabularies are stored:
	- one vast list with all the vocabularies a user knows (if users have to google a word or get to know a new word in other ways, they append it to the list) instead of multiple smaller lists
	- possibility to give labels to words to query specific categories
- The app will live from frequent but short learning sessions to replicate all vocabularies in the users knowledge
